# Meta Learning

## Real Life Intuition

1. Learn to perform new tasks with only a few new examples.
2. Learn to fine-tune hyper-parameters of machine learning algorithms. (Humans are meta-learners themselves.)

## Domain Related Intuition

1. Learn from other machine learning algorithms, or use outputs from other machine learning algorithms to perform new tasks.
2. Meta learning is as known as auto machine learning, referring to the automated model selection and hyper-parameter tuning.

## Key Concepts

1. Meta-Learning Algorithms (Meta-Algorithms/Meta-Learners)
   1. Meta-Classifiers: for classification tasks.
   2. Meta-Regressors: for regression tasks.
2. Meta-Learning Models: Result of meta-learning algorithms.
3. Ensemble Learning: Machine learning algorithms that combine results from multiple models.
4. Stacked Generalization (Stacking): A meta-learning model that learns to combine results from multiple predictive models.
