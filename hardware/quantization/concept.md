# Quantization

## Basic Concepts

1. Terms Scale: The ratio of the floating point range to the quantized range.
2. Zero-Point Mean: The representation of the floating point 0.0 in the quantized range.

## Types of Quantization

1. Symmetric Quantization: The zero-point mean is 0.0 in the quantized range.
2. Asymmetric/Affine Quantization: The zero-point mean is not 0.0 in the quantized range.
